## What is it?
Crypto Dragon is my take on a private public key encryptions system using the `cryptography` package and `SHA256` encryption algarytehm

## Get started
To get started you will need python 3.8.1, the script should be compaterbel with later versions tho this is what it was created in after you install python you want to install the cryptography package [here](https://pypi.org/project/cryptography/). When cryptography is installed you can run the main.py file and start the script


I coded Crypto Dragon to be used on linux tho it should work with windows it has not been tested on the windows platform if anyone uses windows please give me feedback on how it runs on that platform
